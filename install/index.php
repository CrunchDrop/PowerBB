		<h1>PowerBB Installation Wizard</h1><p>Before we will install PowerBB Forum, you can read some short notes about this innovative discussion board.</p>
		<p align="justify">The PowerBB Forum project started as an alternative to the big and complex forum systems, like Invision Power Board or vBulletin. The idea behind its development was that a forum must be powerfull yet easy to use. And from my experiences with the before mentioned forums I can tell you that they sure are not easy to install and use.</p>
		<p align="justify">PowerBB is not a clone of any forum. It combines the best features found in every forum system available in a new and unique package. Its speed and ease to use cannot be matched by any other forum. Do not make the mistake and think that PowerBB is graphically handicaped. No Sir.</p>
		<p align="justify">We provide some themes for the users of PowerBB Forum, free to use and modify, but we expect the users to design their own unique themes, because the templating system is very easy to understand. No more database caching of templates; no more 100 files for a simple theme. Just download a single archive and use the in-forum theme installer to install your new theme. No more FTP fuss. No more chmodding, No more transfer problems.</p>
		<p align="justify">Now, you may wonder why is this software free. Because we, at PowerSoftware, think that the best things in life are free. And PowerBB is the best forum ever; don't let us tell you that, you can try and see it with your own eyes.</p>
